        "The **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)** is a widely used metric for evaluating the quality of images generated by generative models such as GANs and diffusion models.\n",
        "\n",
        "FID was introduced in the paper *GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium* by Martin Heusel, Hubert Ramsauer, Thomas Unterthiner, Bernhard Nessler, and Sepp Hochreiter, published in NeurIPS 2017 (~20k citations as of Oct 2025).\n",

        "\n",
        "Its main idea is to measure how close the **distribution of generated images** is to the **distribution of real images**, but since comparing high-dimensional image distributions directly is intractable, FID does this comparison in a **feature space** learned by a pretrained neural network — typically the Inception-v3 network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, both real and generated images are passed through the network, and the resulting feature vectors (usually from a late pooling layer) are modeled as **multivariate Gaussians** with estimated means and covariances $(\\mu_r, \\Sigma_r)$ and $(\\mu_g, \\Sigma_g)$. The FID is then computed as the **Fréchet distance** (or **2-Wasserstein distance**) between these two Gaussians:\n",
